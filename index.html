      <h1>My Name is Beckham</h1>

      <h2>Welcome:</h2>
      <div>

      <p> I am a computer programming student at York County School of Technology. I am currently attending my second year in the "Computer Programming and Interactive Media" class.
  
      </p>
  <br>
      <p> During my years at York Tech, I have earned my "CompTIA ITF+ certification" as well as my "OSHA certification" for the 10-hour general industry course. I have also worked on projects such as a proposal for a new school website and working on the Unitree Go1 robot dog. Currently, I am working on the class formbar, an open source classroom management tool.
  
      </p>
  <br>
     <p>Recently, I have been working on applying to different colleges to further expand my career opportunities and obtain a degree in a study that will aid me in having a future doing the things I love for a living.

     <h3>"Robodog" 2023-2023</h3>

     <p>In my senior year, I worked on a group project called "Robodog." This was a project to use the Unitree Go1 robot dogs built in microphone and speakers to control it through voice commands. While on this team, we succesfully were able to access the dogs raspberry pi, create a copy of its SD card, and control the dog through running code in a terminal.</p>
     
     <h3>"Formbar.js" 2023-Present</h3>
     <p>The Formbar is an open source classroom management tool designed by my teacher. This is a tool that allows the teacher to create and control classes, create polls and questions for students to answer and view "Break Requests" and "Help Tickets." This tool was created to manage the classroom easily through a website. For example, a student can send a help ticket to the teacher which will notify them that they require assistance on their work. So far I have worked on fixing bugs and implementing quality of life fixes. It is planned that one day every class in the school will have access and be able to make use of the Formbar website.  </p>
