      <h1>My Name is Beckham</h1>

      <h2>I do stuff:</h2>
      <div>

      <p> I am a computer programming student at York County School of Technology. I am currently attending my second year in the "Computer Programming and Interactive Media" class. (The class where I learned to create this portfolio!)
  
      </p>
  <br>
      <p> During my years at York Tech, I have earned my "CompTIA ITF+ certification" as well as my "OSHA certification" for the 10-hour general industry course. You can see both of these certifications on the right. I have also worked on projects such as a proposal for a new school website and working on the Unitree Go1 robot dog. Currently, I am working on the class formbar, an open source classroom management tool.
  
      </p>
  <br>
  <p> You can also see a picture of my class attending a tour of the York College campus. 

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Outside of the classroom, I enjoy art, primarily drawing and origami, and photography. I am also currently working as a busser at Crimson American Grill, where I have been working since August, 2022. 
    
  </p>
<br>
  <br>
     <p>Recently, I have been working on applying to different colleges to further expand my career opportunities and obtain a degree in a study that will aid me in having a future doing the things I love for a living.

     </p>

      Thanks for taking the time to check out my resume, as I reach different goals and achievements, more will be added.
